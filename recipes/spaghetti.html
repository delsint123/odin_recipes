        <h3> Ingredients </h3>

        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li> 1 pound lean ground meat </li>
            <li> 3 tablespoons olive oil </li>
            <li> 1 cup chopped onion </li>
            <li> 3 garlic cloves, minced </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons tomato paste </li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano </li>
            <li> Pinch crushed red pepper flakes </li>
            <li> 1 cup water, broth or dry red wine </li>
            <li> 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes </li>
            <li> Salt and fresh ground black pepper </li>
            <li> Handful fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving </li>
            <li> 12 ounces dried spaghetti or favorite pasta shape </li>
            <li> 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps </h3>

        <ol>
            <li> Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the 
                meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden 
                spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles. 
            </li>

            <li> Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 
                5 minutes.
            </li>

            <li> Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, 
                stirring continuously for about 1 minute.
            </li>

            <li> Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion 
                stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a 
                generous pinch of black pepper.
            </li>

            <li>  Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. 
                As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning 
                accordingly. 
            </li>

            <li> About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted 
                water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check 
                for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.
            </li>

            <li>
                Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, 
                and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, 
                and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.
            </li>
        </ol>
