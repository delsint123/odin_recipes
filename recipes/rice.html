        <h3> Description </h3>

        <p> This is itâ€”the foolproof recipe for making perfect rice on the stove. If cooking rice 
            makes you nervous, know that you are not alone.  Even really accomplished cooks get 
            intimidated by plain old rice.
        </p>
        <p> My mother had a friend who made extravagant, authentic Chinese meals, and then sent 
            her husband to go pick up rice from the local Chinese restaurant.  Another friend of 
            mine headed up one of the best test kitchens in the country, and when she has a chili 
            party she asks one of the guests to bring the rice. 
        </p>
        <p>But we're going to solve the rice-phobic issue today.  Rice is too awesome not to know 
            how to make easily.  It's the most perfect side dish for so many different meals, and 
            soaks up sauces like a dream. Pair a scoop of fluffy rice with anything from Asian 
            dishes like Chicken, Broccoli and Sugar Snap Pea Stir Fry, Spicy Stir Fried Beef and 
            Vegetables or Lemon and Scallion Chicken Stir Fry.  Or serve it with Mustard and Maple 
            Pork Kebabs or Citrus Basil Shrimp Kebabs. There are few foods I can think of that don't 
            partner well with rice.

        <h3> Ingredients </h3>

        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li> 2 cups water </li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon butter or oil (optional) </li>
            <li> 1 cup long grain white rice </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps </h3>

        <ol>
            <li> Bring the water to boil in a medium saucepan. Add the salt and butter and allow
                the butter to melt. 
            </li>

            <li> When the water has returned to a boil, stir in the rice. Let the water return 
                to a light simmer. Stir again, cover the pot and turn the heat down to low. Keep 
                the rice simmering slightly, and keep the pot covered (you may have to peek after 
                a few minutes to make sure the heat is at the correct temperature, but then let 
                it cook, covered). Start checking to see if the rice is tender and all of the 
                liquid is absorbed at about 17 minutes. It may take up to 25, especially if you 
                are making a larger quantity of rice.
            </li>

            <li> When the rice is cooked, turn off the heat and let it sit for another couple of 
                minutes to finish absorbing any liquid. Take off the lid, fluff the rice with a 
                fork and let it sit for another 2 minutes or so, so that some of the excess moisture 
                in the rice dries off.
            </li>
        </ol>
