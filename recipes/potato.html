        <h3> Description </h3>

        <p> A perfect baked potato is hard to beat. The outside is brown and crisp, coated in a 
            crust of sea salt. Pierce the skin, and your fork gives way to a soft, fluffy interior. 
            It might be hard to resist eating the whole thing straight out of the oven, but if you 
            take the time to top it with a pat of butter or a dollop of (cashew) sour cream, you 
            won't be able to deny that it was worth the wait.
        </p>
        <p> Reading this, you might be surprised to learn that until recently, I wasn't a baked 
            potato fan. I thought they were bland on their own. Whenever I had them at restaurants
            or at home as a kid, the toppings were always the main attraction. The potatoes themselves 
            would be shriveled and soft, meager vessels for sour cream, cheddar cheese, and bacon.

        <h3> Ingredients </h3>

        <ul>
            <li> 4 medium russet potatoes </li>

            <li> Sea salt </li>
            <li> Cashew Sour Cream </li>
            <li> Tempeh Bacon Bits </li>
            <li> Chives </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps </h3>

        <ol>
            <li> Preheat the oven to 425Â°F and line two baking sheet with parchment paper. 
            </li>

            <li> Use a fork to poke a few holes into the potatoes. Place on the baking sheet,
                rub with olive oil, and sprinkle liberally with sea salt all over. Bake 45 
                to 60 minutes, or until the potato is fork-tender and the skin is crisp.
            </li>

            <li> Slice open each potato. Assemble with a dollop of sour cream or cashew cream, 
                tempeh bacon bits, and a sprinkle of chives. Serve with remaining cashew cream 
                and tempeh bacon on the side.
